Ica stig- dialog-intro
 
-Hey! You must be the new employee I was told about. Welcome to the job kid!
-My name is Stig but you might know me as ICA Stig?
-Let's get started with your training right away?
 
-your job is to sit here in the register and greet customers. When charging them there are a few things to keep track of!
-when scanning the customer's item make sure to not scan 'em too fast or too slow! we don't wanna stress our customers now do we?
-Now we are a cash only store so remember, no credit cards allowed. Also make sure they have enough money. were not running a charity here?
- also there will be some underage rascals tryna buy some "restricted" items. So make sure to keep track of the customer's ID if they look suspicious?
-if they aint got a valid ID or enough money just click on them to ask them to either leave or cough up the cash?
-you got all that?

svara ja och då går vi vidare? säg nej och så repeterar han alla instruktioner

-great kid welcome to the family. Now ill let you get to work ill check up on you at the end of your shift?

-good luck kid! see you around?



















slutet av dagen 

-hey kid! I see your first day went great. but now i need you to do a personal favor for me??

- you see now at the end of the day, I often need help with some miscellaneous task in the store..

-these tasks can vary but the important thing that you need to remember about this is that if you do a good job there is a chance for a bonus?

-I think that's about everything. Welcome to the family, kid!
